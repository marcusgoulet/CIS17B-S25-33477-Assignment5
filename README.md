- this is a basic program that highlights the functions of templates and template specializations. This program is
  comprised of a package class template and is used to determine the TypeName/TypeId of specified packages. Another template
  is also used to convert type names into readable strings, this was an issue I was personally running in to. This program 
  also covers utilizing pointer to string outputs, list appending using templates and data type function specializations 
  that output different prompts per each type.
