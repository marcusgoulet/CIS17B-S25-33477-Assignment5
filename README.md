- This is a basic program that highlights the functions of templates and template specializations. This program is
  comprised of a package class template and is used to determine the TypeName/TypeId of specified packages. Another template
  is also used to convert type names into readable strings, this was an issue I was personally running in to. This program 
  also covers utilizing pointer to string outputs, list appending using templates and data type function specializations 
  that output different prompts per each type.
- The program file necessary to run is located inside the source folder of this repo, named just "main.cpp". You can download the file or copy the code into your favorite IDE in order to run this program.
